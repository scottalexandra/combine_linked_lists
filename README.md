### Combine Two Linked Lists

You are given two sorted linked lists. The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order.
Merge all data into a single linked list, which is also sorted in ascending order at the end of this process. Don't use arrays or any other data structures to complete this work, linked lists only!
Neither linked list will be empty; each linked list will contain at least one item.
Your function should return an ARRAY of the elements in the last linked list
